## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
**KR3 Infosys** is a specialized technology consultancy delivering high-velocity **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** and **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** operations for the world's most demanding enterprises.  

We do not simply support software; we engineer the **Identity Nervous System** that powers Fortune 500 continuity. By fusing deep expertise in market-leading security stacks (CyberArk, SailPoint, Entra ID) with a proprietary, containerized automation engine, we eliminate operational friction and enforce absolute security sovereignty.

Our "Operations-as-Code" methodology fundamentally transforms how enterprises handle access—moving from reactive ticketing to proactive, automated resilience.

## **CORE COMPETENCIES: THE INTEGRATED SECURITY FABRIC**

### **1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
*Deploying the perimeter-less future while stabilizing mission-critical legacy estates.*
*   **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**: End-to-end architecture of adaptive access policies, Conditional Access rules, and hybrid identity syncing for global workforces.
*   **StrongDM (Legacy Infrastructure)**: Specialized operational support for StrongDM specifically within complex legacy environments, ensuring secure, auditable access to databases and servers without disrupting established workflows.

### **2. Privileged Access Management (PAM)**
*Zero-Trust enforcement for the "Keys to the Kingdom."*
*   **Akeyless Vault**: Next-gen implementation of dynamic secrets and Just-in-Time (JIT) access, reducing the static credential attack surface to near zero.
*   **CyberArk Core Security**: Enterprise-grade deployment of CyberArk PAS, encompassing Vault management, PSM (Privileged Session Manager), and CPM (Central Policy Manager).
*   **Cloud Secret Sovereignty**: Deep engineering of **GCP Secret Manager** and **Azure Key Vault**, integrating seamless secret fetching into application runtimes and CI/CD pipelines.

### **3. Identity Governance & Administration (IGA)**
*Automated compliance and lifecycle intelligence.*
*   **SailPoint (End-to-End)**: From initial deployment to steady-state operations. We engineer policy-based access control (PBAC), automated provisioning/deprovisioning workflows, and granular access certification campaigns to ensure continuous compliance.

## **THE X-FACTOR: STRATEGIC AUTOMATION ENGINE**
**"We don't just fix operational drifts; we script them out of existence."**

What separates KR3 Infosys from traditional MSPs is our **Containerized Operations Architecture**. We aim for a Zero-Touch operational model, powered by a custom-developed ecosystem of logic.

*   **Polyglot Scripting**: A library of advanced operational scripts (Python/Bash) customized to interact with API endpoints of SailPoint, Entra, and Akeyless for bulk remediation and reporting.
*   **Containerized Tooling (Docker & Podman)**: All operational tools are packaged as immutable **Podman/Docker containers**. This ensures that our support infrastructure is portable, version-controlled, and completely isolated from valid system dependencies.
*   **Rapid Response**: Because our logic is containerized, we can deploy patches and operational fixes across global nodes in seconds, not days.

---

## **PAST PERFORMANCE & SCOPE**
**Current Engagement: Fortune 500 Infrastructure Support**
*   **Scope**: Full-stack deployment and 24/7 operational support of the complete IAM/PAM suite.
*   **Scale**: Managing identity lifecycles for global employees/contractors and securing thousands of privileged endpoints.
*   **Achievement**: Successfully migrated legacy access patterns to a modern, automated governance model while maintaining 99.99% uptime for business-critical access.

---

## **COMPANY DATA**
*   **Differentiator**: Boutique agility with Enterprise-grade rigor.
*   **Focus**: Pure-play Identity Security & DevSecOps.
*   **Support Model**: Follow-the-Sun (24/7) Engineering coverage.
